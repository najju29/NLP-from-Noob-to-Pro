# NLP-from-Noob-to-Pro
This one is like a one stop for all the things you need to know in Natural Language Processing.


**Contents:**
- 1. Classical Machine Learning approach for NLP
  - Text Preprocessing (Level 1)- Tokenization,Lemmatization,StopWords,POS
  - Text Preprocessing (Level 2)- Bag Of  Words, TFIDF, Unigrams,Bigrams,n-grams

- 2. Word Embedding + Deep Learning for NLP
  - Training Word Embeddings from Scratch:
    - Using RNNs (like LSTM,GRU) on custom Word Embeddings.
  - Using Pre-Trained Word Embeddings.
    - Gensim,Word2vec,AvgWord2vec.
    - GLovE, Fasttext.
  
- 3. Transformers:
    - Bidirectional LSTM RNN, Encoders And Decoders, Attention Models.
    - Transformers.
    - BERT.
